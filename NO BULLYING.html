							<span class="image left"><img src="images/03 back-04.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

							<h2>DESIGN</h2>
							<h4>DESIGN CONCEPT</h4>
							<p>On each one’s position, there is always a decision-making process that could either reduce or increase bullying. Everyone counts no matter in the processa victim, a bully or a bystander.
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/03 back-06.png" alt="" /></span></p>
							<h4>PROJECT GOAL</h4>
							<p>A chance to view things through three different perspectives. There are actions for users to take on each step and in the end, different results with data based on behaviours. Hope this process will enhance empathy and raise awareness of bullying and do something in the future when they face the bullying again.

							<h4>WALKING PATH</h4>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/03 back-08.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h4>STORY BOARD</h4>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/03 back-09.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h4>SCREEN</h4>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/03 back-10.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h4>REPORT</h4>
							<p>When the user experiences the whole process and exists, he can get a self-report by recognizing own figerprint on the machine. The report contains what the user has done or leave in the room and data about actions. For example, at the front, you touched weapons or you could have stopped the bully for how many times and, at the back, you helped or make public more aware of bully for how many times.
