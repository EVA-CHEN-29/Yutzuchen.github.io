								<br>3. We came out the conclusion that despite physical needs, one of the most important needs for the aging is to build connectivity with the world.
								<br>4. We Made a system for elderly in finding their interests after retirement.
								<br><b>After this workshop</b>,
								<br>1. I gained a deeper understanding of elderly group.
								<br>2. I come up with embryos of ideas to solve the problems of strong social needs between students in the elderly schools. 
								<br>3. I target a smaller group- seniors learners in the elderly schools, hoping to make some changes through my individual efforts.

								<p><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></p>	
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/06 back-02.png" alt="" /></span>
									1. Many countries around the world are facing severe aging social problems. China's aging process is the world's number one. By 2020, China's aging population will reach 355 million. In 2050, it will reach 437 million, accounting for more than 30% of the total population.</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/06 back-03.png" alt="" /></span>
									2. At present, there are more than 62,000 old-age universities and senior schools at all levels in the country, with more than 8 million students and more than 5 million students participating in distance learning.</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/06 back-04.png" alt="" /></span>
								3. For the retired senior learners, they have more free time and may lose the focus of work and social interaction.They may feel life has no sense of purpose, loneliness, emptiness, and easy to cause various mental illnesses.</p>

								<h2>RESEARCH</h2>	
								<h4>HAPPY FIFTY-OLD UNIVERSITY</h4>

								<h2>USER JOURNEY MAP</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/06 back-09.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h2>DESIGN THINKING</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/06 back-10.png" alt="" /></span>
								I want to make <b>a display system</b> for senior learners in the elderly schools.
								<br>This display system enables senior learners to have more interations through work sharing. They can use to find suitable classes or chat with their classmates and teachers in or out of the class.
								</p>

								<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

								<h2>STORYBOARD</h2>
								This shows how to use display system. We will know how this app changes Mrs Shen’s life in and out elderly school and how she feels.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/06 back-11.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h2>FLOWCHART</h2>
								This app aims to create a platform for the elderly to feel connected in the classroom by <b>sharing works</b> with each other. The senior learners could <b>choose their classroom</b> first and then see works that related to a specific interest. They can also search and apply to join in the specific classroom to <b>upload</b> their class works or performance pictures. In the classroom homepage, the elderly can <b>socialize</b> with their classmates or those who share the same interest in the way of comments, click likes or add to favorite. They can also <b>manage their own single work page</b> and see others’ as well.
