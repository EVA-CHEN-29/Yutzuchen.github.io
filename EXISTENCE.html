							<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
							    <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/01 back.png" alt="" /></span>One day, i happened to see this: It is normal to drop a hair on the head; if you drop one, you don't have to worry; if you lose one, you still don't have to worry...In the long run, a hair falls and finally the bald appears. This phenomenon is called
								 "The Bald Man Paradox" in philosophy. This is raised by Eubulides of Miletus
								 who was a philosopher of the Megarian school, and a pupil of Euclid of Megara. Eubulides is well-known for his paradoxes.</p>

							<h2>DESIGN thinking</h2>
							<p>Vagueness is an attribute of existence and non-exsistence. Then, what is the relation of these twoï¼Ÿ</p>
							<p>	<span class="image main"><img src="images/01 back-03.png" alt="" /></span></p>
							<h2>DESIGN CONCEPT</h2>
							<p>I want to focus on the critical point and conclude three key words for my design.</p>
							<p>	<span class="image main"><img src="images/01 back-09.png" alt="" /></span></p>
							<p>	<span class="image main"><img src="images/01 back-04.png" alt="" /></span></p>
							<h2>SKETCH</h2>
							<p>I use the wire frame and the arrangement of LED lights to symbolize the changing world. The criss-crossing point and line, as we are in this world, is complicated in law. Every time you touch the device, the corresponding light will be generated. This is the critical point you touch among existing obejects. As you keep touching for several times, screen will change at the same time, which means emotional changes inside.</p>
							<p>Components needed: Arduino UNO, Macbook, Projector, Wire, Switch, Led lights and Mirror</p>
							<p>	<span class="image main"><img src="images/01 back-05.png" alt="" /></span></p>
							<h2>FUNCTION FLOW</h2>			
							<p>This is a circulation. The person touches the object to trigger the lights. The LEDs light in a specific order back and forth. When it comes back, the screen will react as well like a emotional response inside a person.
									When the person touches the second time. The light will light again. But this time, light with double speed, which represents a deeper familiarity between two sides. It speeds up for the third time.
									This process means that the relationship between two sides  get stronger and deeper as they keep in contact. However, everything will disappear in the end, leaving an unforgettable memory which exists forever.</p>

							<h2>PREPARATIONS</h2>	
							<p>	<span class="image main"><img src="images/01 back-07.png" alt="" /></span></p>	
							<h2>MAKING PROCESS</h2>	
							<p>The boundaries between existence and non-existence are very vague. Sometimes, we tend to keep things as they used to be. The more contacts will bring stronger emotional connections. After several contacts, we begin to think about what is the meaning of being existence and non-existence.
									There are eight steps of making process: test leds,build rigs and sold; color black; link to basis circuites; build connection; coding; make the basis; display set and test.</p>
